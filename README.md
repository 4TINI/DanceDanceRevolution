# DanceDanceRevolution
For the sensors laboratory at Politecnico di Milano we were asked to realize the well known game from the 90s building from scratch the capacitive sensors to realize the platform controller of the game. An Arduino Board was chosen to control all the sensors. A graphical interface was also a request of the assignment. We decided to realize it with Processing a Java based IDE. The two components, ArduinoMicro and graphical computer interface communicate through serial communication.

## Software
The Graphical interface has been realized through Processing, a Java based Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Game Architecture
The Architecture of the game is inspired by the classical arcade video games that had an extremely simple layout for the options with a large, dominating logo taking up the majority of the screen real estate and a quickly scannable list of options.
